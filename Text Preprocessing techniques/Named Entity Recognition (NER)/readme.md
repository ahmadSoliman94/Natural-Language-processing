### __Named Entity Recognition (NER):__ is a task of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that involves identifying and classifying named entities in a text into predefined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, and others.

<br />

- ### NER involves using machine learning algorithms to automatically recognize and classify named entities in text data, based on their context and characteristics. NER can be applied in a wide range of applications, such as information extraction, question answering, text classification, and sentiment analysis.

<br />

- ### The output of NER is a structured representation of the text, where named entities are tagged and classified according to predefined categories. NER is a critical component in many NLP applications, as it helps to extract structured information from unstructured text data, making it easier to process and analyze.

<br />

## -  How NER works:
1. ### __Detect a named entity:__ involves detecting a word or string of words that form an entity. Each word represents a token: “The Great Lakes” is a string of three tokens that represents one entity. 
2. ### __Categorize the entity:__ requires the creation of entity categories.
